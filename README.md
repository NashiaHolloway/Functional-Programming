# Goal
 The intention of this project is to gain continued experience in functional
programming and compare the implementation Scala to that a pure functional language (Scheme)
and that of imperative and logic programming languages. In doing so, I should develop a
better understanding of functional programming and the concepts behind this class of
programming languages.
